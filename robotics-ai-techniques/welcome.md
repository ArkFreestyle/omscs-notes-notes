# Welcome

## Howdy Friends

Here are my notes from when I took RAIT in OMSCS during Summer 2020.

Each document in "Lecture Notes" corresponds to a lesson in [Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/cs373). Within each document, the headings correspond to the videos within that lesson. Usually, I omit any introductory or summary videos, as well the as office hours lessons.

## Textbook Information

The following textbook may be helpful:
- [Probabilistic Robotics (Intelligent Robotics and Autonomous Agents series)](https://amzn.to/3fFW6bR)
- [Linear Algebra Done Right (Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics)](https://amzn.to/2ztcQC8)

## Environment Setup

This class requires some environment setup. I have recorded the following YouTube walkthroughs, which may be helpful:

- [Up and Running with Anaconda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHIPgi6LRo)
- [Configuring PyCharm and Conda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhpCHv7kuoo)
