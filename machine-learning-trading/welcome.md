# Welcome

## Howdy Friends

Here are my notes from when I took ML4T in OMSCS during Spring 2020.

Each document in "Lecture Notes" corresponds to a lesson in [Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud501). Within each document, the headings correspond to the videos within that lesson. Usually, I omit any introductory or summary videos.

There is a lot of information in these documents. I hope you find it helpful!

If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or improvements, don't hesitate to reach out to me. You can find me at:
